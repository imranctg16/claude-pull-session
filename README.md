# pull-session

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) **plugin** that finds your sessions **across every local instance and project** and pulls a chosen one's **summary** into your current session.

You run `claude`, `claude2`, `claude3` in different terminals (different config dirs), across different repos. One of them worked something out and you want *this* session to know — without copy-pasting a wall of transcript. Install the plugin, then:

```
/pull-session:pull-session
```

lists every session it can find — newest first, tagged by **instance · project**, with a **● live** flag for ones active right now:

```
[1] ● live  Jul12 13:22  default · Youtube Channels
      ↳ we have a conversation exported here, i need you to load it…
[2] ● live  Jul12 13:22  work    · Job Portal
      ↳ …
[3]   idle  Jul10 17:32  claude3 · CampaignFlow
      ↳ lets do a fun thing, separate from the project…
```

Pull one in by number (or id):

```
/pull-session:pull-session 3
```

…and that session is asked (headlessly, under **its own** config dir) to summarize itself — goal, decisions, files touched, current state, open threads — and the summary drops into your current session as context.

## Why this exists

Claude Code sessions are **independent by design** and each instance has its **own config dir**. `--resume`/`--continue` only *switch to* a prior session **in the current instance**; nothing merges or imports across sessions — let alone across instances or projects. This fills that gap with an on-demand, cross-instance **pull**.

## Install

This repo is a Claude Code marketplace containing the plugin. In any Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add imranctg16/claude-pull-session
/plugin install pull-session@imran-plugins
```

Then use `/pull-session:pull-session`. Requires `claude`, `bash`, `jq` on PATH.

## Usage

- `/pull-session:pull-session` — list all sessions (all instances, all projects), numbered, with ● live flags.
- `/pull-session:pull-session <number|id>` — pull that session's summary into the current one.
- `/pull-session:pull-session <number|id> --force` — pull a **live** session anyway (see caveats).

## How it discovers sessions

- Scans config dirs that contain a `projects/` dir: `$PULL_SESSION_DIRS` (colon-separated override) · `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}` · `~/.claude`, `~/.claude-*`, and the same one level up (to catch HOME-swapped instances). There's no registry of instances in Claude Code, so scanning is the intended approach.
- Session transcripts live at `<config-dir>/projects/<cwd-dashed>/<session-id>.jsonl`; the project name shown comes from the transcript's `cwd`.
- **● live** = written within `$PULL_SESSION_LIVE_WINDOW` seconds (default 120). Claude Code has **no session lock/PID files**, so recent-write is the only signal — treat it as a hint, not proof.
- Summaries use `claude -p --resume <id>` run under that session's own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, not raw-`.jsonl` parsing (the format is undocumented and transcripts can be tens of MB).

## Caveats (by design / by platform limits)

- **One-way, on-demand snapshot** — not a live two-way sync.
- **Costs one small summarization call** per pull.
- Pulling **appends a summary turn** to the target session. Harmless when idle; for a **live** session it can interleave with the running instance, so live sessions need `--force`.
- **No pre-merge compaction from outside.** Claude Code's `/compact` is interactive-only — there's no headless way to compact a session you're not in. To shrink a live session before merging, run `/compact` in *its* terminal first; this tool will remind you.
- Cross-instance labels reflect the config dirs as seen from the running instance.

## Config (env vars)

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PULL_SESSION_DIRS` | — | Colon-separated extra config dirs to scan (for non-standard layouts). |
| `PULL_SESSION_LIVE_WINDOW` | `120` | Seconds since last write to still count as ● live. |
